# Attrition-Forecasting

## Overview
Welcome to our Project 4! In this project, we aim to solve the critical business problem of predicting customer attrition. Customer churn can significantly impact a company's revenue, making it imperative to understand the factors contributing to attrition and build a predictive model for proactive retention strategies.

### Problem Statement
Customer Attrition Prediction is a vital task for businesses across industries. Our project focuses on leveraging machine learning to analyze and predict customer churn, providing actionable insights for businesses to retain valuable customers.

## Technologies Used
Our project is powered by a diverse set of technologies and libraries, demonstrating our proficiency in machine learning, data manipulation, and visualization.

**Machine Learning Library:**
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): Utilized for implementing various machine learning algorithms.

**Data Manipulation and Analysis:**
- [Python Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Employed for efficient data manipulation.

**Visualization:**
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Used for creating insightful visualizations.
- [JavaScript Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/): Integrated for interactive visualizations.

**Web Interface:**
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap: Utilized for building an interactive web interface.

**Database:**
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): Employed for dataset storage and management.

**PreReqs**
- Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform)
- Start Docker
```
docker build -t flask-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-api
```
# Requirements
**Data Model Implementation**
- A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model
- The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling
- The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark
- The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared.

**Data Model Optimization**
- The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself
- Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script
